# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook and its cleanup function.  The example showcases a scenario where the cleanup function, crucial for preventing memory leaks and unexpected behavior, is not called when the component unmounts.  This is usually due to improper usage of useEffect or component lifecycle interference.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a React component with an `useEffect` hook. Although it includes a cleanup function, it's not always correctly executed.  This can lead to issues such as:

- **Memory Leaks**:  If the effect creates resources (e.g., timers, subscriptions), failing to clean them up can lead to memory leaks.
- **Unexpected Behavior**:  The cleanup function might be responsible for resetting state or canceling ongoing operations, so its absence can lead to unexpected side effects.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The key is ensuring that the cleanup function is appropriately defined and executed during the unmounting process.  In this case, this might involve carefully reviewing the componentâ€™s lifecycle and handling unmounting scenarios.
